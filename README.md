# ChildTheme

In order to create a ChildTheme, you need to choose and install a parent theme (In this example, our parent theme is "Tweenty Seventeen")

Create your ChildTheme in wordpress/wp-content/themes

Add a functions.php to link your childtheme to your parent theme.

Add a style.css and start edit your theme.
